## Abstract

The strong coupling of an atom to a cavity offers unparalleled control over the interaction of quantum states of light and matter. A priori deterministic single photon sources, based on vacuum stimulated Raman processes (V-STIRAP), can leverage this control to produce single photons in a wide range of exotic quantum states, for example, temporally long excitations with arbitrarily shaped wavepackets [1]. The importance of polarization in photon routing and quantum networking schemes motivated the pursuit of polarized cavity-based photon sources [2]. How-ever, unforeseen perturbative effects of the magnetic field, required to polarize the emission, limited the efficiency of such schemes [3, 4]. We propose a method to efficiently generate polarized photons by recycling the magnetic state of an 87Rb atom with an additional Raman process.
