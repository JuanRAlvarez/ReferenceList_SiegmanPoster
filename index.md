## Abstract

The strong coupling of an atom to a cavity offers unparalleled control over the interaction of quantum states of light and matter. A priori deterministic single photon sources, based on vacuum stimulated Raman processes (V-STIRAP), can leverage this control to produce single photons in a wide range of exotic quantum states, for example, temporally long excitations with arbitrarily shaped wavepackets [[1](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/13/10/103036/pdf)]. The importance of polarization in photon routing and quantum networking schemes motivated the pursuit of polarized cavity-based photon sources [[2](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/aafaba/pdf)]. However, unforeseen perturbative effects of the magnetic field, required to polarize the emission, limited the efficiency of such schemes [[3](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/aad14e/pdf), [4](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/317/5837/488)]. We propose a method to efficiently generate polarized photons by recycling the magnetic state of an 87Rb atom with an additional Raman process.

## Motivation

Single photons produced using ￼$^{87}\text{Rb}$ have proven to produce long photons (~300 ns) with a high degree of control. 

Generation efficiency of polarized photons needs to be improved further, as the ￼$^{87}\text{Rb} D_2$  line becomes highly nonlinear with the magnetic fields used. 

Production of efficient, polarized single photons is necessary to perform cavity based atom-atom entanglement.
